# On Nonlinear Learned String Indexing

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments in the paper:

> Paolo Ferragina, Marco Frasca, Giosuè Cataldo Marinò, and Giorgio Vinciguerra. On Nonlinear Learned String Indexing. 2023. (under review)

## Run the code

Refer to [ANN/README.md](ANN/README.md) for instructions on how to train and evaluate the various artificial neural network models.
Refer to [FST/README.md](FST/README.md) for instructions on how to compile and run the various configurations of the succinctly-encoded trie.
The plots can be created with the Python notebook in the [results](results) folder.
